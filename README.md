# PiRacer-tweaks
I followed the instructions on the waveshare wiki https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/DonkeyCar_for_Pi-Setup_Raspberry_Pi to get the base of the car. So far, I have only modified 3 of the files.
I've named the files according to how you would access them from the home directory in the Pi. 

Issues with these modifications: the front wheels seemingly randomly turn, without any attempt on my part to move them. The back wheels will also twitch, although not as often as the front wheels. Also, for all intents and purposes, it doesn't drive in reverse. Attempts to have it do so result in increased front wheel twitching and start-stop back wheel rotation in the desired direction.
