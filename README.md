# PiRacer-tweaks
I followed the instructions on the waveshare wiki https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/DonkeyCar_for_Pi-Setup_Raspberry_Pi to get the base of the car. So far, I have only modified 3 of the files.
I've named the files according to how you would access them from the home directory in the Pi. 

Issues with these modifications: the front wheels seemingly randomly turn, without any attempt on my part to move them. The back wheels will also twitch, although not as often as the front wheels. Additionally, it's very difficult to consistantly drive 10 laps to get the needed data to train it. As it drives much more consistantly backwards, I am working on getting the images that way. This page will be updated should I have any success.
